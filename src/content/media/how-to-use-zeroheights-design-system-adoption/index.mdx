Check out this demo from one of our engineers, Rosie, for help getting started with our new tools for measuring design system adoption.

You can track your design system packages and see which repos are using the latest versions. You can also track component usage to see which of your components are being widely used. These handy new tools should make it easier to track how your design system is being adopted across the organization.
