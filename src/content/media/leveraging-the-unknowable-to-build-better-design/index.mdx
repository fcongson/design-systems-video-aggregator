Trenton is the key designer and change driver behind nib Group's Mesh Design System. Initially developed to enable the white-labeling of private health insurance, Mesh has grown to enable and support new businesses, opportunities, and markets beyond its functional roots - but as its influence has grown, so have the problems it needs to solve.

In this session, Trenton will share insights from nib's journey towards a platform-agnostic, brand-agnostic design system, realised through design tokens and deep reflection on what it means to find common ground.

This is a unique opportunity to learn from real-world experiences and overcome design system rigidity, a topic that is sure to pique your interest.
